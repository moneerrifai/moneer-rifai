A couple of years ago, I found myself stuck in a dead-end job and was itching to break into a career in the cloud, but I did not know how to.

After discovering AWS, I came up with a plan: I was going to get all three associate-level certifications, and that would make me a cloud developer in extreme demand, right? 

I just need to cram for a couple of tests. Easy peasy!

So how did that plan pan out?


# Brief Overview of AWS Certification Path

As of 2020, AWS has multiple tracks for certification: 

1. Foundational: for those completely new to the cloud and seeking to get a general understanding. Avoid this track if you are more technically-minded
2. Associate: this is where most people will start (and where I started). The Solutions Architect is a good one to pursue.
3. Professional: recommended only after 2+ years experience, and I really encourage you to follow this recommendation
4. Specialty: deep dives into specific topics that require lots of experience and knowledge (security, networking, etc.)

For most technically-inclined people, I recommend you start with the the associate-level certification.


# Are Certifications Worth It? The Good, the Bad and the Ugly

Certifications are a controversial topic in IT. Some people swear by them, others think they are overrated.

I kinda agree with both those sentiments!

Let me explain.

If you think a certification alone will make you an expert in a given topic, then you are in for a surprise. You will not gain expertise by passing a test. This attitude is what gives certification a bad rap. I am sure you might have met someone in your field that acts like they are the ultimate expert in the field because they are certified, but in reality, they seem to lack the basics. Those people are the worst!

But if you understand that certifications alone are not going to magically make you an expert, then they become a great tool. Two of the  main benefits of pursuing certifications:

1. They provide an easy-to-follow path for studying and self-learning: for complex topics like AWS services, one can be easily overwhelmed, but having a defined and structured list of topics to cover makes it much easier to learn and become familiar with those topics

2. While most technical hiring managers tend to be indifferent about them, many recruiters and HR people like them, so having a certification could potentially improve your chances of being noticed and might benefit you in your job application process

# How I Broke Into the Cloud Career

As I mentioned before, a couple of years ago I decided that pursuing the three associate certifications from AWS would be all I need to break into a career in the cloud.

After months of studying, I did manage to pass all three certifications and I started applying to jobs.

I was getting called back, but my interviews were not going that great. 

While the knowledge I gained from all those certifications was helpful, it was not the only thing employers were looking for. In my pursuit of passing my AWS tests, I ignored to focus on other skills that were equally critical.

One of the most critical skills I ignored at the time: knowing how to write quality code. It turns out that writing code is one of the most important skills that employers are looking for.

There are other skills that you will need to develop if you want to break into the cloud, but do not fall into the same trap of thinking that simply learning about the cloud and getting certified is enough.

As for me, after many failed interviews and after realizing what my areas of weaknesses were, I went to work on filling the gaps. For me, certifications were extremely helpful in getting me noticed and getting me the initial interviews, but I ultimately needed to supplement my knowledge with additional skills.

# Should You Pursue Certifications?

Definitely!

If you are new to the cloud, or interested in jumpstarting your career, pursuing an AWS certification will be a great place to start.

Depending on your background and skill level, I highly recommend you start with the AWS Solutions Architecht - Associate certification, and then possibly pursue the two other certifications afterward (Developer and SysOps Administrator certification). Unless you have a couple of years of experience in the cloud, do not pursue the professional-level certification.

But do not stop with the certification: understand that more than likely, you will need to supplement with additional skills and experience.

# Call to Action

I highly recommend you explore the certification path that AWS offers and consider pursuing a certification. There are tons of learning material online, but my favorite content is Udemy. You can find courses on pretty much every topic and they have some great courses specifically tailored for AWS certifications.

Additionally, I have put together a free ebook that outlines the various skills that you need to develop if you are interested in a career in the cloud. You can get my ebook for free here.

I would love to hear your experience, feedback and questions on this topic. Do you have a certification or are you considering pursuing one?
