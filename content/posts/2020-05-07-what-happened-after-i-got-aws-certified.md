A couple of years ago, I found myself stuck in a dead-end job was itching to get into the cloud, but I did not know how to.

After discovering AWS, I came up with a plan: I was going to get all three associate-level certifications, and that would make me a cloud developer. I just need to cram for a couple of tests. Easy peasy!

So how did that plan pan out?

# Leared a Ton While Getting Certified
