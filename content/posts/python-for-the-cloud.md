## Introduction

If you have an interest or already work with cloud computing, you probably already know the importance of being a strong developer. Cloud and code go hand in hand.

But when it comes to programming languages, there are many strong opinions on benefits of certain languages over others. Advocates of a certain language will often argue with religious zeal why you should learn it over any other.

In this article, I will hopefully remove that uncertainty and tell you why **Python** is really the only language that you should learn.
