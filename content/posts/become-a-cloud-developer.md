Unless you have been living under a rock, you probably know that "becoming a web developer" is all the rage.

In 2011, the first coding bootcamp appeared, and over the next few years, they exploded in popularity. There are now countless in-person bootcamps and online programs. Some of them are even free, like freeCodeCamp.

All these programs are great, but for the most part, they focus on one thing: web development (and sometimes mobile development).

The common path is something like this:

1. Learn frontend web development (HTML/CSS/JavaScript)
2. Learn backend development
3. Practice and build a portfoloio
4. Apply for jobs

This obviously can vary from one program to another, with different programs focusing on different aspects of web development, but it is a very popular path that new developers follow, and a decent path to be honest.

### The Problem

So why am I writing about this?

Well back in 2017, I was catching the "development bug" and I wanted to be part of this.

After finding an online program that was a good fit for me, I proceeded the next few months learning web development.

### Problem 1: Market is Getting Saturated

The explosion of these bootcamps and the wide availability of online resources has been a blessing for those 

### Problem 2: Competition

### Problem 3: Economic Slowdown
