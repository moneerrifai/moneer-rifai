#### Professional Skills <a name="professionalskills"></a>

What I do in a nutshell: I use code (primarily Python) to architect and automate cloud infrastructure (primarily AWS).

Some of my skills:

- Cloud: AWS <i class="fab fa-aws"></i> <br>
  This is the only cloud provider I currently work with. I have all 3 AWS associate certifications and currently working on my Solutions Architect Certification - Professional.<br>
  AWS services I am experienced in: EC2, S3, VPC, Lambda, Step Functions, Route 53, ECS, ECR, CloudWatch, CloudFormation

- Code: Python <i class="fab fa-python"></i> <br>
  Python is probably one of the best languages for the cloud. I heavily use the Python SDK for AWS (Boto3)

- Tools: Git, Docker, VS Code

#### Personal Story <a name="personalstory"></a>

I was born and raised in Lebanon, in the Middle East. My family is of Palestinian origin who left Palestine in 1948. 

I moved to the US (Minnesota) in 2000 to attend university. In 2007 I met my amazing wife Emma and we got married in 2009. We now live in Iowa City, IA where she is pursuing her PhD in religious studies and expects to graduate soon. We have 2 cats named Mulder and Scully (if you're younger than 30, you might not get the reference!)

I work remotely, and I love it!


#### Hobbies and Interests <a name="hobbiesandinterests"></a>

While I love tech, there is so much more outside the world of tech that I enjoy, like:

- Reading: I read a lot, but not enough. Classics (War and Peace and Walden are two of my favorite classics) to history, philosophy, productivity, business, and science. One of my favorite books that I read recently is Deep Work, but Cal Newport. Read it, I guarantee that it will change you life.

- Fitness: I enjoy being active. Some of what enjoy: going to the gym, running (I have participated in many races from 5k to marathons), soccer (I play on a local team), cycling (I rode across the US once, and I have done RAGBRAI), hiking (hiked a lot in the mountains of Washington and Montana, especially Glacier National Park), and anything that gets me outside to enjoy the beautiful gift of nature.

- Community: I love being active in my community. I am involved with several community and volunteer groups with a focus on community-building, giving back, and promoting dialogue.

- Speaking: I am a member of Toastmasters. I have spoken at local tech events and workshops focused cloud and DevOps. I have also had the honor of speaking at bridge-building and interfaith community events.

- Mentoring: empowering others, in any way that I can, is one of my priorities. To that extent, I am committed to helping others where I can provide value. Please check out my contact page if you think I have anything of value that I can provide to you.

### FAQs<a name="faqs"></a> (Frequently Asked Questions)

##### Cloud Development FAQs

<details><summary>I want to become a cloud developer. How do I start?</summary><br>
You came to the right place. I put together a step-by-step plan for you. Please start by downloading my <a href="https://www.moneerrifai.com/ebook" target="_blank"> free eBook</a>.
</details>

<details><summary>I read about how you got your AWS certifications. I currently work as an ____ (insert your job title here). What kind of job can I get if I get AWS certified?</summary><br>
As I mention in my <a href="https://www.moneerrifai.com/ebook" target="_blank">eBook</a>, simply getting a certification is not going to magically make you a cloud developer. A certification provides a good path for learning the theory, but you will need to supplement that with development knowledge, as well as hands-on experience.
